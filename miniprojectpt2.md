## Project Revisions:

The original scope of the project was to look at how the minimum wage no longer supplied affordable housing in any state.

#### Layout Revisions:

Based on the feedback that I recieved from part one of the mini-project, I decided to change the general layout of my presentation and website. My original wireframe went from

      Explaining wage policy ->
      Looking at state/federal minimum wage differences ->
      Examining maps of affordability ->
      Examining characteristics of minimum wage workers ->
      Recommendations and call to action
      
While I thought this would be a reasonable start, what I found was that looking at the characteristics of minimum wage workers wasn't as compelling a reason to some of my audience members. Instead of focusing on a narrow segment of the workforce, why not look at the average workers' wage was their suggestion. This required a new layout and new visualizations in my project. The new wireframe, as shown above now goes:

      Examining housing costs ->
      Looking at what is considered affordable housing ->
      History of the federal minimum wage ->
      Looking at differences in state minimum wages ->
      Example of how all states are unaffordable at minimum wages ->
      Considering affordability in the context of average wages ->
      Example of how some states are unaffordable to the average workers' wage ->
      Recommendations and call to action
      
This required a lot of new datasets and visualizations.
