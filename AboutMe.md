# About Me

Hello classmates, professors, prospective employers, and anyone else reading this site! My name is John Boyle (he/him), and I am currently wrapping up my Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM) degree from the Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. My main focus at Heinz has been improving my quantitative and qualitative skills to find a policy analyst job, particularly in the fields of education, energy, or transportation. On a more personal note, I will add that gainful employment in any field or position would be a happy consolation prize in our current pandemic job market.

I came to Heinz College straight from working as a Staff Assistant for U.S. Senator Tim Kaine in 2016. I greatly enjoyed my time working in his office, but I wanted a position that was more involved in the legislative process and thought that Heinz would be the best place to build the quant skills I did not have. I ended up taking some time off between my first and second year here, allowing me to work on his Senate re-election in 2018 as a Field Organizer in Chesapeake, Virginia. My goal still remains to work in public policy, though not necessarily in the public sector. In addition to my interests in public policy I am a **BIG** fan of all sports related to Virginia Tech or the City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia. Do not be surprised if one week I manage to include 76ers or Flyers statistics in a graphic.
