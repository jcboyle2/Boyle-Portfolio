# Mini Project - Final Story

## Project Summary

#### Introduction and Outline:

As housing costs have steadily risen over the past 40 years, the earnings for minimum wage workers haven't matched those increased cost of living. Now, in 2020, no state is affordable to a minimum wage earner, and in some states not even affordable to the average wage earner. This project will examine potential wage and housing policy solutions, as well as what you can do to help in your community.

The general outline of the project will go as follows:

    1. Examining housing costs ->
    2. Looking at what is considered affordable housing ->
    3. History of the federal minimum wage ->
    4. Looking at differences in state minimum wages ->
    5. Example of how all states are unaffordable at minimum wages ->
    6. Considering affordability in the context of average wages ->
    7. Example of how some states are unaffordable to the average workers' wage ->
    8. Recommendations and call to action

#### Method and Medium:

The project will be presented through a [Shorthand site](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-unaffordable-american-dream/index.html) and will be online.

#### Data Sources:

All data in this project is publicly avaliable, made by U.S. federal agencies. This includes:

 - [1] [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisitics - Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2019/home.htm)
 - [2] [U.S. Department of Labor - Minimum Wage History](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/history)
 - [3] [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development - Fair Market Rent History](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html#history)
 - [4] [U.S. Department of Labor - Median Weekly Earnings of Full Time Workers](https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpswktab3.htm)
 - [5] [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - Occupational Employment Stats](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrcst.htm)

[1] Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers - used to describe the general characteristics of workers, mostly to correct misconceptions about minimum wage workers. Most minimum wage earners are above the age of the age of 25, and have at least a high school diploma.

[2] Minimum Wage History - used to create charts related to minimum wage history over time, and current values of state minimum wages. Anything that references minimum wage levels references these tables.

[3] Fair Market Rent History - used to create anything related to mapping average rent values for apartments in the U.S. This includes both creating a national average, state average, and county level (using FIPS) data, and dates back to 1983. Fair Market Rent is calculated by HUD, and is available for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 bedroom apartments. Recent analysis of affordable housing tend to focus on the 2-bedroom apartments as the benchmark.

[4] Median Weekly Earnings - currently not being used in the wireframe, but may be informative in explaining the gap between earnings and affordable housing.

[5] Occupational Employment Stats - Hourly/monthly/annually wage data for each state from May 2019. Used to compare against the affordablility wage calculated with FMR history data.

## Project Design and User Research

#### Original Sketches:

#### User Research Protocol and Findings:

My target audience, both for the presentation and for interviewees, are middle-class, educated people who are less likely to have worked a minimum wage job (outside of high school/college) or have lived the effects of poverty. This audience, I believe, would be most impacted by learning about the challenges of some of the most vulnerable Americans and would have the means to make a difference in their community.

Of the interview targets I identified, here are the questions I asked them:

    1.	How familiar are you with the minimum wage? Affordable housing?
    2.	An individual working a full time minimum wage job makes roughly $15k a year. Do you think that is above or below the poverty line? (it is above - $12,760)
    3.	What characteristics would you use to describe a minimum wage worker?
    4.	What do you think is the average fair market rent for a two bedroom apartment is in your state/nationwide? (read figure to them)
    5.	Do you think that is affordable? If not,
    a.	If you could quantify the cost of affordable housing what would it be?
    6.	Show draft visualizations â€“ ask what the like/dislike, if confusing, etc.
    7.	Ask what policies would they be willing to support to address housing affordability issues.

What I found was that my interviewees were aware of what the minimum wage was in their area, but were not aware of what that meant in terms of monthly/annual salary and housing costs. Similarily they were not able to put that in context of the federal poverty line, or what would constitute affordable housing. They seemed less interested in the characteristics of the minimum wage workers and instead the context of average workers within a state. This caused me to rework a lot of the second half framework. I kept the basic history charts as I thought those were simple and clean, and necessary for educating people who may not know more of the details in wage/housing policy. Instead of using the state/federal difference chart from the framework - I made it a map in tableau which was a more efficient use of space and data for my site.

From there, I added to the inforgraphic in the wireframe - an example of affordability applied to the state of Wisconsin. From there, I decided to change the map to a range plot showing the gap between each state's minimum wage and the affordability wage to highlight how big the gap is in every state. Because some of my interviewee's were more interested in the population as a whole, I found data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment Stats, which had each states median and average hourly wage for all workers. I used this to make a second range plot to show that some states are still unaffordable even for the average worker's median wage.

Overall, I felt it made my presentation stronger to be able to point to states where it is unaffordable for the average of all workers, and not just the small fraction of minimum wage workers.
