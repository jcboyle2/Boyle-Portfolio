# Mini Project - Summary and Outline

## Project Summary:

The minimum wage no longer supports affordable housing in any state. This project will examine how we got here, why that matters, and how wage and housing policies could work to solve the problem.

## Project Outline and Structure:

All sketches and images below are just that - sketches - and subject to significant revision.

The basic structure will start by introducing the main concept - the U.S. proposed a federal minimum wage as a living wage, yet raises in the minimum wage haven't kept up with rising housing costs. In this case, housing costs are defined by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Fair Market Rent (FMR) formula. In the aggregate, this will look at the national average FMR for a 2-bedroom apartment and at the individual state level.

Because Fair Market Rent values are not the same in each state, we will briefly look at states with higher and lower state minimum wages compared to the federal minimum wage.

Even when taking into account differences in state and federal minimum wages, no state currently supports affordable housing. In this case affordable housing is defined as spending 30% of your monthly income on housing costs.

Currently I have a map from tableau looking at which states are the most unaffordable and the least unaffordable, but this is subject to change. I was also considering looking at a Top 5 Most/Least Unaffordable States.

From there, the project would examine who are typically minimum wage workers, and our conceptions of those demographics.

Lastly there is an examination of policy proposals for both wage and housing policies that could help remedy this issue.

## Call to Action:

The call to action in this case is multipronged. There is encouraging local, state, and federal office holders to increase minimum wage polices - attending local housing/zoning meetings to encourage more sustainable development - and to participate in local organizing efforts in your neighborhood or community.

## User Research and Feedback

TBD!
