# What I Hope to Learn

Before coming to Heinz, my knowledge of data visualization was from everything such as the professional graphics in stories from the *New York Times* or *Wall Street Journal*, government publications like the U.S. Energy Information Agency, or the Tableau pages of Evolving-Hockey, a public analytics site. Data is everywhere, but it isn't always readily understandable. It is important to know the statistical significance of your data, but its equally important to have the ability to communicate that to someone too. Whether you are examining coronavirus case trends in the United States, projecting future fossil fuel consumption in developing international markets, or trying to show who has the most valuable non-entry level contract in the NHL - you are going to need to convey that in a clear way.

I have seen a lot visualizations, good and bad, that I have thought to myself, "I can do better than that!" But now I have the chance to try to learn how exactly to do that in Telling Stories with Data. I hope that I can learn through this class how to accuractely communicate meaningful findings, whether that is for something as important as public policy, or as trival as sports analytics. Not only do I think this will be an important skill for my professional development, but also as a means of diving deeper into my own interests and passions.
